Backcord is an evil bot client. Built with discord.py so you need to install discord.py with `pip install discordpy`.

I explained all commands in commands.md, i also explained how to add cogs in cogs/readme.txt so check them out.

Um... and i think thats it not much to explain. Im not good at explaining things lol.

And im not responsible for any harm or something (whatever you got what i mean).

Hope you enjoy!
